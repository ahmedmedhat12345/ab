# Real Estate Valuation AI 🏡

A Data Science and Machine Learning project that predicts house prices and categories, deployed as an interactive Streamlit app with AI-powered insights.

## Features
- **Price Prediction**: Uses an optimized XGBoost Regressor (with Log-target transformation).
- **Category Classification**: Classifies properties into 'Budget', 'Standard', or 'Luxury' using Random Forest.
- **AI Explanations**: Provides context-aware market insights using OpenAI (with a robust manual fallback if API key is missing).
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for easy user interaction.

## Files
- `real_estate_project.ipynb`: The core Jupyter Notebook containing Data Cleaning, EDA, and Model Training.
- `app.py`: The Streamlit application source code.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `*.pkl`: Trained models and feature lists (generated by running the notebook).
- `data.csv`: The dataset (ensure this is present to train models).

## How to Run Locally

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Generate Models**:
    Run the Jupyter Notebook `real_estate_project.ipynb` to train the models and create the `.pkl` files.

3.  **Run the App**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

1.  Fork/Clone this repository to GitHub.
2.  Log in to [Streamlit Share](https://share.streamlit.io/).
3.  Deploy the app by selecting `app.py`.
4.  (Optional) Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Streamlit Secrets to enable the advanced AI explanations.
